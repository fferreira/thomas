# Thomas the parser engine
A PEG parser generator, but mostly an experiment to write parsers that can be expressed at runtime that generate concrete syntax trees (as opposed to to ASTs) and for which one can easily write tooling and languages that can change their own syntax at runtime.

The idea is for this library to become the parser library I always wished to have. We will see how far I can get before life distracts me with other things.

**Note:** The project is named after Thomas Holloway the founder of Royal Holloway, University of London.
